Log-shuttle is an open source UNIX program that delivers messages from
applications and daemons to log routers and processors via HTTPs.

One of the motivations behind log-shuttle is to provide a simpler form of
encrypted & authenticated log delivery. Using HTTPs & Basic Authentication is
simpler than the techniques described in RFC5425. TLS transport mapping for
Syslog requires that you maintain both client & server certificates for
authentication. In multi-tenant environments, the maintenance of certificate
management can be quite burdensome.

When using log-shuttle with logplex it is recommended that you spawn 1
log-shuttle per logplex token. This will isolate data between customers and
ensure a good QoS. Log-shuttle accepts input from stdin in a newline (\n)
delimited format.

When using log-shuttle with [Amazon's
Kinesis]("http://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/"), all the details for the region,
stream and access credentials are supplied in the -logs-url (or $LOGS_URL env
variable). See the Kinesis section of this document.

To block as little as possible, log-shuttle will drop outstanding batches if
it accumulates > -back-buff amount.

## Kinesis

log-shuttle sends data into Kinesis using the
[PutRecords](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_PutRecords.html)
API call. Each Kinesis record is encoded as length prefixed rfc5424 encoded
logs as per [rfc6587](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6587#section-3.4.1) (this
is the same format logplex accepts). One record per log line.

Log-shuttle expects the following encoding of -logs-url when using Amazon
Kinesis:

    ```
    https://<AWS_KEY>:<AWS_SECRET>@kinesis.<AMAZON_REGION>.amazonaws.com/<STREAM NAME>
    ```

See the [Amazon Endpoints
documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#ak_region)
for supported regions and hostnames.

### Kinesis Caveats

Things that should be handled better/things you should know:

1. `AWS_SECRET`, `AWS_KEY`, `AMAZON_REGION` & `STREAM NAME` need to be properly
   url encoded.
1. log-shuttle assumes a 200 response means everything is good. Kinesis can
   return a 200, meaning the http request was good, but include per record
   errors in the response body.
1. The maximum number of records in a PutRecords requests is 500, so set the
   batch size no higher than 498 (500 - 2 records for possible drops / lost).
1. Logplex max line length is 10k, Kinesis max record size is 50k of base64
   encoded data. A `-max-line-length` of somewhere less than 37500 should work
   for Kinesis w/o causing errors.
1. Kinesis does not support the -gzip option as that option compresses the body
   of the request.
1. Even with `-kinesis-shards`, no guarantees can be made about writing to unique
   shards.
